We're building something amazing! The technical architecture documentation is coming soon.

Pull the latest DocumentDB Docker container image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/documentdb/documentdb/documentdb-local:latest
```

Here's a Mermaid diagram of a sample application you can build with DocumentDB:
