# Introduction to DocumentDB

DocumentDB is an open-source document database platform built on PostgreSQL, created by Microsoft and donated to the Linux Foundation. It offers developers a fully permissive, open-source platform for document data stores.

## What is DocumentDB?

DocumentDB provides a NoSQL datastore implemented using PostgreSQL, giving developers complete visibility into the architecture and implementation of the engine. It's designed to offer:

- Full compatibility with MongoDB wire protocol through the `pg_documentdb_api` layer
- Native BSON document support via the `pg_documentdb_core` PostgreSQL extension
- Advanced indexing capabilities including single field, multi-key, compound, text, and geospatial indexes
- Vector search functionality powered by the `pg_vector` PostgreSQL extension
- Enterprise-grade security with SCRAM authentication
- Full PostgreSQL compatibility for advanced SQL operations

## Key Features

- **PostgreSQL Foundation**: Built on the powerful PostgreSQL engine, allowing you to leverage both document and relational capabilities
- **Open Source**: Released under the MIT license with no restrictions on usage, modification, or distribution
- **Document Database Standard**: First implementation towards creating an open standard for document databases, similar to ANSI SQL for relational databases
- **Cloud Ready**: Supports multi-cloud deployments across major cloud providers with native integration in Azure Cosmos DB
- **Developer Friendly**: Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions, including VS Code integration and MongoDB compatibility

## Architecture Components

DocumentDB consists of two primary components:

1. **pg_documentdb_core**: A custom PostgreSQL extension that provides:
   - Native BSON data type support in PostgreSQL
   - Field-level indexing at any nesting depth
   - Multi-key, compound, text, and geospatial indexing
   - Vector search capabilities for AI/ML applications
   - SCRAM authentication mechanism

2. **pg_documentdb_api**: The data plane implementing:
   - CRUD operations with MongoDB compatibility
   - Advanced query functionality
   - Index management and optimization
   - Protocol translation layer for MongoDB wire protocol

## Common Use Cases

- **Modern Web Applications**: Store and query JSON documents with MongoDB compatibility
- **AI/ML Applications**: Leverage vector search for similarity matching and embeddings
- **Hybrid Data Models**: Combine document and relational data in the same database
- **Migration Path**: Easy transition from existing MongoDB workloads
- **Local Development**: Full-featured local instance for development and testing
