# Node.js Setup Guide

Learn how to set up and use DocumentDB with Node.js using the official MongoDB Node.js driver.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or later
- npm or yarn package manager
- DocumentDB installed and running (see [Pre-built Packages](prebuilt-packages.md))
- Docker installed (if set up is not completed yet)
- Basic Node.js knowledge

## Project Setup (skip if already done)

Before connecting from Node.js, make sure you have a running DocumentDB instance using Docker:

   ```bash
   # Pull the latest DocumentDB Docker image
   docker pull ghcr.io/documentdb/documentdb/documentdb-local:latest

   # Tag the image for convenience
   docker tag ghcr.io/documentdb/documentdb/documentdb-local:latest documentdb

   # Run the container with your chosen username and password
   docker run -dt -p 10260:10260 --name documentdb-container documentdb --username <YOUR_USERNAME> --password <YOUR_PASSWORD>
   docker image rm -f ghcr.io/documentdb/documentdb/documentdb-local:latest
   ```
> **Note:** During the transition to the Linux Foundation, Docker images may still be hosted on Microsoft's container registry. These will be migrated to the new DocumentDB organization as the transition completes.
>
> **Note:** Replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>` with your desired credentials. You must set these when creating the container for authentication to work.
>
> **Port Note:** Port `10260` is used by default in these instructions to avoid conflicts with other local database services. You can use port `27017` (the standard MongoDB port) or any other available port if you prefer. If you do, be sure to update the port number in both your `docker run` command and your connection string accordingly.

## Installation

1. Creating a new Node.js project
   ```bash
   mkdir my-documentdb-app
   cd my-documentdb-app
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Installing the MongoDB driver
   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```

## Connecting to DocumentDB

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const client = new MongoClient(uri);

async function connect() {
  try {
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('your_database');
    return db;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Connection error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Basic Operations

1. Creating collections
   ```javascript
   const collection = db.collection('your_collection');
   ```

2. Document operations
   - Insert operations
   - Find operations
   - Update operations
   - Delete operations
